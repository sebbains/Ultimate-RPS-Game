# The Ultimate Rock, Paper, Scissors Game!
Unlike the traditional game, choose how to fight, dodge, power up and win.

Originally developed as the traditional RPS game I decided to pivot into a more Pokemon based version of the game in order to learn more about objects, arrays and playing with the DOM. Currently built with knowledge gained from FCC up to completing basic Javascript lessons and self exploration of the DOM.

* HTML5
* CCS3
* Vanilla Javascript

## Learnings
